# pond_model
Own iteration of the WLP model presented by Pearce et al. (2017) - see at 
10.1073/pnas.1710339114 or https://github.com/bennski/Wet_Dry_Cycling_Pond_Model.
The code has been modified to be concise and to give the opportunity to explore different parameterspaces, e.g. temperature or UV radiation strength.
